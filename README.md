# BaseProject_MicroChip_PIC24FJ256GA705
This is a base project/example for the MicroChip PIC24FJ256GA705 Curiosity Board.
It includes libraries I made for each component we needed to use in College:
* LEDs and RGB LED
* Potentiometer (ADC)
* Switches

I tried to use Macros to make use of the compile time as a lot of the operations are just register assignments.
